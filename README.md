## Introduction

In this project, we aim to provide implementations of common data structures and algorithms in C. These implementations can serve as learning resources, reference material, or as components in larger projects.

## Features

- Implementations of various data structures such as:
  - Arrays
  - Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly)
  - Stacks
  - Queues
  - Trees (Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, etc.)
  - Graphs
- Algorithms for sorting, searching, and graph traversal, including:
  - Sorting algorithms (Bubble sort, Quick sort, Merge sort, etc.)
  - Searching algorithms (Linear search, Binary search)
  - Graph algorithms (Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Dijkstra's algorithm, etc.)
